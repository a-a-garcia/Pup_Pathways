NAME - Pup Pathways

The purpose of this app is to allow users to chart the route they walk their dog(s), and be able to see if their routes intersect with any other users. Users should be able to chart what times/days they walk. I am hoping this would be useful for connecting dog walkers who walk the same path to socialize (or even avoid socialization with dogs that are hostile).
